# Story time

A place to show you know how to commit and have git configured at home and also in the lab.


## Note on Commits
Make sure all of your commit messsage reflect what step you are doing. "Added stuff" is not sufficient. 

# Directions
The goal is to learn the edit/add/commit/push workflow and realize it isn't that bad after some practice.

0. Make a new directory (folder) in your home directory for your APCS1 labs and assignments e.g. `~/Documents/apcs1/`.
1. Clone the repo into your `apcs1` directory.
2. Edit the `story.txt` file in the lab by replacing words as follows: Edit three times once each for nouns/verbs/adjectives then adding/committing/pushing. You should have 3 commits in the lab after this step. After all three commits your story should be complete.
   

# Submit summer assignment HelloWorld here!

3. Copy your "HelloWorld.java" from the summer assignment to the local repository. You should have it in the cloud/email/flash-drive, so you have to save it into the correct directory (the repo folder), drag/drop, use the cp command, or google how to achieve your task)
4. Use the command "git status" to see what happens with new files, you will notice it says that HelloWorld.java is not being tracked.
5. Add/commit/Push the HelloWorld file. This case is an example of when a simple commit message is sufficient. 



6. Complete steps The rest of the directions at home on your personal device.
7. On your personal device clone the repo.
8. Make an edit to the story.txt file on the git website interface. There should be this one commit from the web interface, but no more. **You will AVOIDðŸ”¥ using this manner of editing your work**.

ðŸ”¥Using the git web interface instead of adding from the terminal is a really easy way to hurt yourself in the long term. It is only to be used for minor NON-CODE edits like the readme file. DO NOT edit code this way. All of your personal devices MUST be able to make/push changes.

9. Pull those changes onto your personal device.
10. Make more changes on your personal device (add formatting or change the [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/markdown-cheatsheet) ) and push them to github. Do this 2 times so there are 2 more commits (6 total commits, 3 in the lab, 3 at home.)
11. All of the "madlibs" style placeholders should be replaced when you are done with 6 total commits, some formatting changes, and optionally some git markdown.
